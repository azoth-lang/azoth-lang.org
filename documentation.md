 For those interested in learning what makes Azoth unique, the draft language reference is the best resource.

* *Draft* [Language Reference](https://github.com/azoth-lang/azoth.language.reference/blob/master/src/book.md)
* *Draft* [The Design of the Azoth Language](https://github.com/azoth-lang/azoth.language.design/blob/main/book.md)

<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Great language design is about getting many
individual decisions correct and giving developers powerful tools without so
much rope that they can hang each other. Most languages are marred by poor
decisions or foot-guns like monkey patching or arbitrary operator overloading.
All the elements for a great language are now in place and common patterns are
becoming apparent. We just need to learn the lessons of history and give the
language enough time to gel into a cohesive whole composed of orthogonal parts
before locking in bad design.</p>
