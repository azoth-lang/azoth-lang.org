<q>Great language design is about getting many individual decisions correct and
giving developers powerful tools without so much rope that they can hang each
other. Most languages are marred by poor decisions or foot-guns like monkey
patching or arbitrary operator overloading. All the elements for a great
language are now in place and common patterns are becoming apparent. We just
need to learn the lessons of history and give the language enough time to gel
into a cohesive whole composed of orthogonal parts before locking in bad design.</q>

        <h2>Ideal Uses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong></strong>Concurrent and Parallel Programing</strong>:
            structured concurrency and reference capabilities enable worry-free
            concurrency and parallelism.</li>
            <li><strong>Serverless Development</strong>: no startup time and
            multiple entry points</li>
            <li><strong>Correct and Robust Programs</strong>: design by
            contract, error handling etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reference Capabilities: also no global mutable state</li>
            <li>Flexible Static Typing with Local Type Inference</li>
            <li>Write Once, Compile to Anywhere</li>
            <li>Structured Concurrency</li>
            <li>Instant On: no startup overhead, almost immediately executing
            entry point function</li>
            <li>Multiple Entry Points: enable serverless, supported by dead code
            elimination so each entry point gives compact executable.</li>
            <li>guaranteed optimizations</li>
            <li>asynchronous everywhere</li>
            <li>Implicit Interfaces</li>
            <li>Compile-Time Code Execution: user literals (can parse), </li>
            <li>Optional Exception Specifications</li>
            <li>Design by Contract</li>
            <li>Null Safety: Fix the billion dollar mistake. All references
            non-null by default with powerful null handling and null
            coalescing</li>
            <li>Paradigm Fusion: enables all different paradigms in a way that
            fits together. Fuses OO, Functional, Structured Concurrency, Lang.
            Oriented, Procedural, into a cohesive whole. Enable DDD, first class
            functions, default to immutable, side-effects visible</li>
            <li>Language-Oriented Programming</li>
            <li>term? No Special features in libraries, anything the language
            can do, a library can do. Not primitive types, operators that only
            apply to built in and can't be overloaded. No literals for built in
            types.</li>
            <li>Package Management: not just about the language, it is about the
            package eco-system. Packages are versioned with an extension of
            semantic versioning but that can be disabled</li>
            <li>Unsafe Code and C Interop: unsafe is there as an escape hatch
            but is restricted so that libraries can be trusted to be free from
            bugs due to unnecessary unsafe code.</li>
            <li>Compact Executables: minimal runtime - GC and green-thread
            manager. Dead code elimination. Apps can be single executables or
            for multiple executable can be shipped with static shared
            libraries.</li>

        <h2>Other Uses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Desktop Development</li>
            <li>Full-stack Development: once web assembly supports GC can develop in Azoth on browser too. Concurrency features</li>

        <h2>Powerful Libraries</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Units of Measure and Quantities: underlying type and units optional generic
            parameters. Example <code>Length</code> is <code>Length[float64,
            m]</code>. But <code>Length[int, year]</code> or
            <code>Length[yds]</code> and <code>Length[int, yd]</code>. Can mix
            these types. If multiply <code>Length[yd] * Length[m]</code> the
            result is <code>Length[yd*m]</code>. Need to do a conversion to
            <code>Length[m^2]</code></li>
            <li>Structured Data: VSON, JSON, YAML, BSON, structure with different parsers</li>
            <li>Embedded Queries: SQL like query as DSL</li>
        </ul>
